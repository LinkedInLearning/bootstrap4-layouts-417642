## Course details
Find out how Bootstrap 4 can transform your standard HTML websites into inspired single-page designs. This course takes a project-based approach to explaining how to manipulate website layouts with the Bootstrap framework.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.

## Branches

The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video. The `master` branch usually has the final state of the code when I finish the course.
